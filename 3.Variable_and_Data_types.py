# There are thousands types of data types in python but in most cases we use only three.

'''
1. String - for plain text
2. Numbers - for digits, numbers
3. Bullein Expression- True or false types


'''




#string is a datatype in python which store plain text
'''
Numbers is a datatype which is used to store number and it doesn't require double quote, if you use double quote to write
numbers then it becomes  string:
'''

# String

name = "Ram"
age = "25"
character_hobbies = "play Chess"

print("There is a man name " + name + "")
print("His age is " + age + ",")
print("His hobby is to "+ character_hobbies + ".")

name = "aakash"

print(name)



# Numbers

age = 15
print(age)

#Difference between string and numbers:

age = 15+35
age2 = "15+35"

print(age)
print(age2)
